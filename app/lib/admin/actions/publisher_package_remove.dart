Removes <package> from its current publisher, and makes that publisher\'s owners
 uploaders.

Fails if that package currently has no publisher.

Example: given a publisher example.com with two members a@example.com and
 b@example.com, and a package:foo in the publisher.

Executing `remove-package-from-publisher  --package=foo` will remove foo from
the publisher and assign a@example.com and b@example.com as uploaders.

If the publisher has no members, the package will end up without uploaders.
