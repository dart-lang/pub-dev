This action will lower the `PackageState.pendingAt` property for the given
package. This should cause an analysis task for the package to be scheduled
sooner.

This will always set `pendingAt` to the same value, it will not trigger new
analysis, if none is pending, merely increase the priority. Calling it multiple
times will have no effect, it will always set `pendingAt` to the same value.

This is intended for debugging, or solving one-off issues.
