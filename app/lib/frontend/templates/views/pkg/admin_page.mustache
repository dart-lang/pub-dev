  <h2>Admin package</h2>

    <h3>Publisher</h3>
    <div>
      {{^has_publisher}}
      <p>
        You can transfer your package to a publisher
        (if you are also an admin of the given publisher).
        The current uploaders will lose access over the package,
        and only the publisher's members  will be able to upload
        new versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>This is an irreversible operation.</strong>
        Packages can be transferred between publishers, but can't
        be used as standalone packages in the future.
      </p>
      {{/has_publisher}}
      {{#has_publisher}}
      <p>
        You can transfer your package to a <strong>new publisher</strong>
        (if you are also an admin of the given publisher).
      </p>
      {{/has_publisher}}
      <p>
        <input id="-admin-set-publisher-input" class="pub-input" placeholder="publisher e.g. example.com"/>
        <button id="-admin-set-publisher-button" class="pub-button">Transfer to publisher</button>

    </div>

    <h3>Discontinued</h3>
    {{^is_discontinued}}
    <div>
      <p>
        If you are no longer developing the package, you can mark it as discontinued.
        The package will still remain available, but pub site won't run analysis on it,
        and we won't display it in search results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <button class="-admin-is-discontinued-toggle pub-button">Mark as "discontinued".</button>
      </p>
    </div>
    {{/is_discontinued}}
    {{#is_discontinued}}
    <div>
      <p>
        If you want to continue developing the package, you can remove its discontinued
        status. Pub site will run analysis on it again, and we will include it in search results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <button class="-admin-is-discontinued-toggle pub-button">Remove "discontinued".</button>
