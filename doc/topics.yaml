# Canonicalizing topics
# =====================
#
# Packages published to pub.dev can define `topics` in `pubspec.yaml`, see;
#   https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec#topics
#
# The list of topics is free-form, and package authors are expected to make up
# new topics as needed. Naturally, this will lead to duplicates and topics that
# only differ in spelling. For example, one package might use the topic "widget"
# while another package uses the topic "widgets".
#
# This file aims to mitigate duplicate topics by establishing _canonical topics_ 
# with descriptions and a list of aliases.
#
# Aliases for a topic will be resolved when the `pubspec.yaml` is parsed.
# Ensuring that a package tagged with the alias "widgets" will appear on pub.dev
# as if it had been tagged with the canonical topic "widget".
# Similarly, search queries will be normalized to canonical topics.
#
# Topic descriptions serve as documentation for next time an aliases is
# proposed. Descriptions can also be used in tooltips or topic listings:
#   https://pub.dev/topics
#
#
# Canonical topic format
# ----------------------
#
# Entries in the `topics` list in this document, must have the form:
#
# ```yaml
# topics:
# - topic: <canonical-topic>
#   description: <description for use in tooltips, documentation, etc>
#   aliases:
#   - <aliases-topic>
#   - ...
# ```
#
#
# Contributing
# ------------
#
# You are welcome to submit pull-requests with additional aliases, canonical
# topics and/or improved topic descriptions. 
#
# Please limit pull-requests to propose one topic per PR!
#
#
# Editorial guidelines
# --------------------
#
# The decision on whether or not to merge two similar topics can be difficult.
# When in doubt we should error on the side of caution and avoid merging topics.
# However, if mistakes are made these changes are reversible.
# And we should not be afraid of accepting that sometimes a single topic can
# have multiple meaning, even if this makes the topic hard to use.
#
# The editorial guidelines are intended to evolve as we gain more experience
# merging/managing topics.
