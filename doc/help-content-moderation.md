# Overview of Our Policies and How We Enforce Them

Pub.dev is the official package repository for Dart and Flutter apps.
We strive to support the publication of packages in a manner that is
trustworthy, and works for our users.
The [Pub.dev Policy][1] describes our policies around acceptable use of our
services.
These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our
users and abide by applicable laws.
This Help article provides additional information on how we enforce these
policies.

The Pub.dev Policy prohibits content that is harmful to our users or others
(including name squatting, trademark and copyright infringement, and harmful or
deceptive content).
Please use the "Report package" link at the bottom of each package page to
report illegal content and policy violations.

To ensure efficient review of your policy complaint, please provide the name,
role and contact information of the person initiating the complaint,
a description of and link to the material, and URLs and package names for all
packages related to the complaint.
We cannot take action on incomplete complaints.

Pub.dev moderators conduct human reviews of all reported content.
When assessing content to determine whether it violates our policies, we take
various information into consideration when making a decision,
such as package information (including contents of package archives),
publisher and account information (including past history of policy violations),
and other information provided through reporting mechanisms.

We take action on content that violates our policies and is harmful to users
and the overall pub.dev ecosystem.
If your account or content are found to be in violation, we may:

 * Remove or limit the visibility of the material
 * Temporarily or permanently suspend your access to pub.dev
 * Report illegal materials to appropriate law enforcement authorities

If content is removed or restricted from pub.dev, it is removed or
restricted globally and indefinitely by default.
Egregious violations of our policies may result in more significant enforcement
repercussions, including but not limited to an immediate ban and escalation to
law enforcement authorities.

## How to Appeal a Content Moderation Decision
If you report content or an account, or your content or account was actioned
against, you will receive a notification about the type of enforcement and
the reasoning for any enforcement action taken.
The notification will also contain a link to submit an appeal of our decision
if you believe it was a mistake.
Appeals may not be available in all circumstances
(e.g., certain court ordered removals).

Appeals must be submitted within six months of the content moderation decision.
When submitting an appeal, be sure to include sufficient facts and evidence
necessary to show why our decision was in error.
Appeals that do not include such information, and/or simply restate the facts
and evidence stated in the initial report will be denied.
We reserve the right to take action against users who abuse our appeals
processes, including temporarily or permanently suspending a user’s ability to
submit further appeals if that user makes claims that are spammy,
use inappropriate language, or are otherwise manifestly unfounded.

Once we’ve reviewed your appeal, we’ll communicate the outcome to you.
If we agree with your appeal, we’ll take appropriate action to reverse our
prior decision.

If you’re covered by the European Union’s Digital Services Act (“DSA”),
the option to refer your complaint to a certified out-of-court dispute
settlement body may also be available to you.

If you have legal questions or wish to examine other remedies that may be
available to you, including the option of referring this matter to a court,
you may wish to speak to your own lawyer.
